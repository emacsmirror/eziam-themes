#+TITLE: Eziam Theme

*This package has been renamed from ~eziam-theme~ to ~eziam-themes~ (plural).*
*To get updates, you must uninstall the former and install the latter.*

*I probably don't use Eziam anymore.*

I will try to fix bugs as get reported, but nothing more.

I still enjoy almost monochrome themes.  If you like the Eziam way of
doing things, you may want to steal (by all means please do!) my
Solarized variant, [[https://github.com/thblt/solaris-theme-emacs][Solaris]].  As both Eziam and Solarized use eight
color palettes, it will probably be easy to port Eziam as a Solaris
variant, but this is left as an exercise to the reader :)

-----------

Eziam is a theme for Emacs, which tries to combine the simplicity of [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] with the org-mode goodness of [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Unlike Tao, keeps some very minimal color indications, while remaining mainly grayscale and trying to avoid the “angry fruit salad” syndrome.  Unlike Leuven, it remains mostly grayscale, with no color for syntax, and easily allows multiple variants.  Eziam is really new: ideas, suggestions and bug reports are very welcome, either by [[https://github.com/thblt/eziam-theme-emacs/issues/new][creating an issue here]] or through e-mail at <thibault AT thb.lt>.  Thanks!

** Installation

Eziam is available in the Melpa and Melpa Stable repositories.   If you've already configured at least one of them, all you need to do is either:

 - With bare =package.el=,

   #+begin_src
     M-x package-install RET eziam-theme RET
   #+end_src

 - Or, with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package eziam-theme)
    #+end_src

Both the Melpa and Melpa stable versions are actually stable and fit for daily use; experimental features are tested on separate branches.

(See [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][here]] if you don't know how to use Melpa in Emacs)

** Configuration

Eziam can be customized.  =M-x customize-group RET eziam-theme RET=.

** Credits

Eziam is essentially a mix of two remarkable themes, Peter Kosov's [[https://github.com/11111000000/tao-theme-emacs][Tao]] and Fabrice Niessen's [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/issues][Leuven]].  Although it is technically a fork of the former, it also borrows a lot of ideas from the latter, especially the “generic colors” logic (which may not be original, but as an Emacs Lisp beginner, that's where I found it) and, of course, the great org/markdown outlines.

The name “Eziam” is an extraordinarily bad pun, which I feel like I probably shouldn't explain.  If you don't get it, you're probably OK.
